So, this post was largely inspired by a couple comments Stal made in her video announcing her retirement from FFXIV.

There are a few points Stal raised which I thought were interesting to expand upon (mostly in the context of my theoretical MMO).

### Ultimates do not have sufficient notice

Around the [5:30 mark](https://youtu.be/nJFfZ79Q7Jk?si=L0WgZ1re8BbIvSth&t=330), Stal brings up a point related to Ultimate raiding. Notably, there will be people who will want to challenge themselves and push for world-first levels. These are players who will go *really* hardcore, 16-hour prog sessions over the course of a week or so to clear the fight.

Using *Dragonsong's Reprise* and *The Omega Protocol* as reference, an Ultimate-level raid takes roughly 120 hours of prog; more if you're doing world-first progression where you do *not* have the benefit of looking up guides, simulations, which easily adds to the time commitment.

That being said, because of the nature of the commitment, world-first teams often take a week off work to try and clear the content in time. However, putting real-life on hold for a week is a significant ask, and while doable, real-life commitments would ideally want to know *well* in advance.

In *Futures Rewritten*'s case, the release date (26th November 2024) was only announced with the [Producer Live Letter LXXXIV](https://www.youtube.com/live/pp5OGIamHDU?si=vCx1jM2JzAqgk9Ha) on 1st November 2024, leaving teams just three weeks notice to settle their real-life affairs. While the community had more or less predicted the window which the raid would be released, it would've been nice to have this communicated from the development team earlier.

### Physical Ranged issues

This has been a recurring problem- the development team does not know what to do with the physical ranged slot.

One argument is that the only real reason to bring a Physical Ranged DPS job now is for the 1% bonus.

One might argue that *Dawntrail might* have given the Physical Ranged role something more unique with *Tactician/Shield Samba/Troubadour* now being the only party-wide 15% mitigation, but I don't think that really addresses the problem.

To me, the problem is that there really isn't any resource management anymore- as a result, everything is now measured along a single axis of "how much damage does the job do". Given that D3 can freely move around while still attacking the boss, the natural tradeoff is that D3 simply does less damage (also note that casters do not suffer the same penalty as they have casttimes to restrict their movement).

One axis I think would be interesting would be to lean back into the support role *in context of raiding*. Notably, the D3 role used to have *Refresh*- while MP isn't a problem in shorter fights, it becomes *very* apparent the longer the fight goes. Moving party sustain onto the D3 role might be an interesting direction to take.

### FFXIV content creation metagame

In today's social media age, you *really* want to connect people together on a platform. The comment that Stal makes is that the only Youtube/Twitch content you see from XIV outside of guides is just the same-old reclear or drama react, which also generally skew negatively that doesn't serve any purpose back into the game.

Interestingly enough, FFLogs gives raiders a metagame to play with, as they work on continually improving their performance. Gposing and the adventurer plates are a similar non-combat oriented metagame.

She brings up the content creation scene of old-school Runescape as a good example, although I'm not sure what she means.

XIV doesn't promote a lot of creativity as far as content creation goes (very sandbox).
